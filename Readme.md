# Connectivity Matrices Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains scripts for computing diffusion MRI connectivity matrices, intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity, graph theory measures, and Network-Based Statistics (NBS) analysis. Additionally, it includes statistical analyses to examine group differences across these metrics.

## Folder Descriptions
### `Connectivity_matrices/`
Contains scripts for generating and filtering diffusion MRI-based connectivity matrices using the SENSAAS atlas. These scripts are used to extract structural connectivity information and store it in `.npy` format for further processing.

### `ConnectivitySums/`
Includes scripts for computing inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity sums and running MANOVA analysis on extracted connectivity metrics. These analyses help quantify how hemispheric connectivity differs across groups.

### `GraphTheory/`
Contains scripts for computing graph theory measures, including global efficiency, nodal strength, and clustering coefficients. Analyses involve statistical testing of graph-theoretic metrics to assess differences between groups.

### `NBS/`
Holds scripts for running Network-Based Statistics (NBS) analyses, performing post-hoc tests, and generating visualizations such as BrainNet edge/node files and Circos plots to examine connectivity differences between groups.
